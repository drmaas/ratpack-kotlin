Simplify callback hell with coroutines.

== async servers
This example shows how to execute two promises in parallel.
While they are executing, no compute threads are blocked.
When all have completed, the response is rendered.
```
ratpack {
  handlers {
    get("test") {
      async {
        // "true" executes the promise in a new compute thread in order
        // to achieve parallelization
        val d1 = Promise.value("p1").defer(true)
        val d2 = Promise.value("p1").defer(true)
        val r1 = d1.await()
        val r2 = d2.await()
        render("$r1:$r2")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
