Simplify callback hell with coroutines.

This example shows how to execute two promises in parallel.
While they are executing, no compute threads are blocked.
When all have completed, the response is rendered.
```
ratpack {
  handlers {
    get("test") {
      async {
        // "true" executes the promise in a new compute thread in order
        // to achieve parallelization
        val d1 = Promise.value("p1").defer(true)
        val d2 = Promise.value("p1").defer(true)
        val r1 = d1.await()
        val r2 = d2.await()
        render("$r1:$r2")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
